# Title : "A Comprehensive Approach to Stress Detection and Management Using Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Chatbot Integration"
###
Abstract
In the modern era, mental health issues are increasing rapidly. That is why ourneed a strong and precise stress detection and management system to resolve the issue from the root. To meet this requirement, this research paper proposes an extensive approach that is a combination of machine computational power, software, technology, and sympathetic care. The paperâ€™s approach is based on speech analyses and looks for similarities in frequency patterns to determine the stress level. This paper leverages tools like machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and chatbots. By merging these technologies, it can bridge the research gaps and create an 
extensive framework for stress detection and treatment. This paper discusses the methodology, technologies, and algorithms that are used in this paper and achieves an accuracy rate of 95%, which is a testament to its practical applicability. It also discussed the ethical connotation of such technology and realized its potential application across multiple regions. We hope this research paper will mark a significant contribution to health technology and stress-bursting mission.
